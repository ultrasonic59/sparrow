Edit your /etc/systemd/logind.conf , change #NAutoVTs=6 to NAutoVTs=1

Create a /etc/systemd/system/getty@tty1.service.d/override.conf through ;

systemctl edit getty@tty1
Past the following lines

[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=-/sbin/agetty --autologin root --noclear %I 38400 linux
enable the getty@tty1.service then reboot

systemctl enable getty@tty1.service
reboot

I just want to add to this discussion that the accepted answer pertains to virtual terminals. In my case, 
I had to edit a separate service file which is used for serial terminals. 
The file is found at /lib/systemd/system/serial-getty@.service and the same procedure of adding --autologin <user> to the appropriate line does the trick.

[Service]
ExecStart=-/sbin/agetty --keep-baud 115200,38400,9600 --autologin root %I $TERM
